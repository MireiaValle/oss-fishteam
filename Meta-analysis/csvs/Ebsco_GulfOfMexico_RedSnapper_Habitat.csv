A cage release method to improve fish tagging studies.,"Williams, Laura Jay; Herbig, Jennifer L.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.",Fisheries Research,01657836,,Dec2015,172,,125,5,109395960,10.1016/j.fishres.2015.06.030,Elsevier Science,Article,"Fish tagging; Reef fishes; Mexico, Gulf of; Fish mortality; Underwater acoustic telemetry",Acoustic telemetry; Barotrauma; Predator protection; Release mortality,"The return and survival of tagged fish to their depth of capture has proved difficult due to barotrauma and predation in previous telemetry studies. Tagging stress can slow and disorient the fish upon release, and reduce the ability to return to depth, relocate their home habitat site, and evade predators. To reduce these initial tag and release artifacts we designed and tested a remotely opening cage for use with reef fish in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Our objectives were to quickly return transmitter tagged fish to depth (20–30 m) in close proximity (<10 m) to their capture site, and to increase survival by providing predator protection during an initial recovery period. This cage release method proved successful for both red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus ; n = 62 out of 71, 87%) and all gray triggerfish ( Balistes capriscus ; n = 24) that were tagged and released on artificial reefs. All tagged fish were released from November 2012 to September 2014, no initial tag induced mortalities were observed, and after tagging fish were successfully tracked for extended periods (for the entire 2 year study period).",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=109395960&site=ehost-live
"A Comparison of Size Structure, Age, and Growth of Red Snapper from Artificial and Natural Habitats in the Western Gulf of Mexico.","Streich, Matthew K.; Ajemian, Matthew J.; Wetz, Jennifer J.; Williams, Jason A.; Shipley, J.

Although the stock is now showing signs of recovery, management could benefit from a better understanding of regional or even habitat-level differences in stock demographics, as these dynamics ultimately determine overall stock productivity. From 2012 to 2014, we used a fishery-independent vertical line survey to assess Red Snapper relative abundance, size and age structure, and growth parameters at standing oil and gas platforms, decommissioned platform artificial reefs, and natural banks in the western GOM. We captured 1,170 Red Snapper ranging from 275 to 855 mm TL. Vertical line CPUE data showed no differences among the three habitat types. Ages determined for 1,143 individuals ranged from 2 to 30 years; however, most (90%) were younger than age 8. Size and age frequencies revealed that natural banks supported a greater proportion of large and relatively old fish compared to standing platforms or artificial reefs, although this difference was heavily influenced by a single bank that had significantly larger and older Red Snapper than other sites. Mean age was not significantly different among habitat types. Among a suite of growth models fitted to size-at-age data, the logistic model provided the best fit and suggested that fish from artificial reefs reached larger sizes at age than fish from either standing platforms or natural banks. Our study provides the first estimates of habitat-specific growth parameters for Red Snapper in the western GOM, and this information can benefit future stock assessments. This study also highlights the potential benefits of artificial reefs to Red Snapper and indicates that all habitats could contribute similarly to stock productivity on a per-unit-area basis.

A Life History Review for Red Snapper in the Gulf of Mexico with an Evaluation of the Importance of Offshore Petroleum Platforms and Other Artificial Reefs.,"Gallaway, Benny J.; Szedlmayer, Stephen T.; Gazey, William J.",Reviews in Fisheries Science,10641262,,Jan-Mar2009,17,1,48,20,66905486,10.1080/10641260802160717,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Artificial reefs; Drilling platforms; Life cycles (Biology); Mexico, Gulf of; Ship Building and Repairing; Lutjanus campechanus",artificial reefs; density-dependent mortality; life history; oil and gas platforms; red snapper,"Red snapper mature as early as age 2, have high fecundity (a 10-year-old female produces 60 million eggs per year), and may live for over 50 years. Eggs, larvae, and post-settlement juveniles typically show high rates of natural mortality. For example, of the 60 million eggs produced annually by a 10-year-old female, only about 450 would survive to 5 cm, the size at which they enter the shrimp fishery. Changes in abundance by size and age appear to be consistent with density dependence in survival rate from ages 0 to 1 and likely ages 0 to 2. Red snapper are attracted to structure or reef habitat at all ages, but larger, older fish also occur over open habitat once they have reached a size that renders them largely invulnerable to predation. Artificial reefs comprise a small fraction of the overall high-relief reef habitat, but harbor a large fraction of the present-day age 2 red snapper populations. Prior to the proliferation of artificial reefs in the northern Gulf, age 2 red snapper may have historically occurred mainly over open-bottom, sand-mud benthic habitat where natural and shrimp trawl bycatch mortality was high. Age 2 fish dominate red snapper populations at artificial reefs, whereas the age composition of red snapper at natural reefs usually show older ages are dominant. The present day red snapper fishery is heavily dependent on catches at artificial reefs. Evidence is presented that suggests red snapper production in the northern Gulf likely has been increased by the establishment of significant numbers of artificial reefs.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=66905486&site=ehost-live
A Perspective of the Importance of Artificial Habitat on the Management of Red Snapper in the Gulf of Mexico.,"Shipp, Robert L.; Bortone, Stephen A.",Reviews in Fisheries Science,10641262,,Jan-Mar2009,17,1,41,7,66905485,10.1080/10641260802104244,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Fishery management; Overfishing; Artificial reefs; Habitat (Ecology); Mexico, Gulf of; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Lutjanus campechanus",artificial habitat; management; overfishing; red snapper,"The Gulf of Mexico red snapper fishery has been declared as overfished, and overfishing is occurring. More stringent regulations, including reduced catch quotas and restrictions on the shrimp fishery to reduce bycatch of juvenile snappers, are anticipated. However, with projected rebuilding, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) is estimated to be between 11 and 25 million pounds. This exceeds previously recorded annual yields from U.S. Gulf waters. The fishery began during the mid 19th century off the northeastern Gulf coast, with harvests of only about 2 million pounds. Even at this rate, the stocks were depleted rapidly, and the fleets moved further south and east to find new sources. Numerous exploratory cruises to the western Gulf in the late 19th century found minimal snapper populations, but high concentrations discovered off Vera Cruz, Mexico, attracted fishers, and this area was the major source of snappers for more than a century. The deployment of petroleum structures in the mid 20th century in the western Gulf and thousands of artificial reefs in the north-central Gulf have markedly increased red snapper habitat in those areas. Currently, snapper populations around artificial reefs in the north-central and northwestern Gulf support the majority of the U.S. harvest. If habitat is limiting, the designations of ""overfishing"" and ""overfished"" may be misleading, and ""unrealized harvest potential"" may be a more accurate descriptor of the current status of the stock given the increased presence of additional habitat for red snapper. Decreases in these artificial structures (owing to natural degradation or removal) may decrease future harvest potential.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=66905485&site=ehost-live

Stomachs (n = 708) were extracted and their contents preserved for gut content analysis, and muscle tissue samples (n = 200) were dissected and frozen for stable isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (delta[superscript 13]C, delta[superscript 15]N, and delta[superscript 34]S) analysis. Forty-eight percent of sampled fish had identifiable prey which were grouped into 7 categories: fish, decapods, cephalopods, stomatopods, gastropods, zooplankton, and other invertebrates. A permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) was computed to test the effect of fish size, habitat type, and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill (DHOS) on red snapper diet. Fish size (PERMANOVA, p = 0.021), and the DHOS (PERMANOVA, p = 0.001) were both significant effects in the model, but interactions between habitat type and the DHOS (PERMANOVA, p = 0.049) was also significant. Significant differences in diet among red snapper size categories were due to low trophic position prey items, such as pelagic zooplankton, being more abundant in the diet of larger (>500mm) red snapper, while red snapper in smaller size classes contained greater amounts of higher trophic level prey such decapods and fish. Although no significant difference existed in red snapper diet between habitat types, they consumed slightly higher amounts of decapods at artificial reefs (21.9% of total diet) than natural (14.8%). The significant DHOS effect was driven by an increase in fish and a decrease in zooplankton in red snapper diet following the spill; however, this effect cannot be interpreted independently given the significant interaction between habitat type and the DHOS effect. Zooplankton prey consumption declined and fish consumption increased for red snapper sampled at both artificial and natural reefs after the DHOS, but fish consumption increased to a greater extent at artificial reef sites following the spill. A significant increase in delta[superscript 15]N after the DHOS (ANOVA, p <0.001) also indicates red snapper sampled fed on higher trophic position prey following the spill, and lower delta[superscript 34]S values indicate an increase in benthic versus pelagic prey consumption following the DHOS (ANOVA, p <0.001). The ontogenetic shift in diet observed via gut content analysis was also apparent in the significant effect of fish size on delta[superscript 15]N (ANOVA, p = 0.015). Overall, results clearly indicate the DHOS affected red snapper diet and trophic position, and likely affected the abundance of prey resources as well. Study results also confirm the utility of stable isotope analysis to infer aspects of reef fish trophic ecology.

An Analysis of Artificial Reef Fish Community Structure along the Northwestern Gulf of Mexico Shelf: Potential Impacts of “Rigs-to-Reefs” Programs.,"Ajemian, Matthew J.; Wetz, Jennifer J.; Shipley-Lozano, Brooke; Shively, J.

These habitats can consist of a variety of materials, but in this region are primarily comprised of active and reefed oil and gas platforms. Despite being established for several decades, the fish communities inhabiting these structures remain poorly investigated. Between 2012 and 2013 we assessed fish communities at 15 sites using remotely operated vehicles (ROVs). Fish assemblages were quantified from standing platforms and an array of artificial reef types (Liberty Ships and partially removed or toppled platforms) distributed over the Texas continental shelf. The depth gradient covered by the surveys (30–84 m) and variability in structure density and relief also permitted analyses of the effects of these characteristics on fish richness, diversity, and assemblage composition. ROVs captured a variety of species inhabiting these reefs from large transient piscivores to small herbivorous reef fishes. While structure type and relief were shown to influence species richness and community structure, major trends in species composition were largely explained by the bottom depth where these structures occurred. We observed a shift in fish communities and relatively high diversity at approximately 60 m bottom depth, confirming trends observed in previous studies of standing platforms. This depth was also correlated with some of the largest Red Snapper captured on supplementary vertical longline surveys. Our work indicates that managers of artificial reefing programs (e.g., Rigs-to-Reefs) in the GOM should carefully consider the ambient environmental conditions when designing reef sites. For the Texas continental shelf, reefing materials at a 50–60 m bottom depth can serve a dual purpose of enhancing diving experiences and providing the best potential habitat for relatively large Red Snapper.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=102970286&site=ehost-live

In addition, otolith-based methods were used to determine age, hatch-date, growth and mortality of new recruits associated with FRBH. Date and region were significant factors affecting density of red snapper in 2000. Peak densities of red snapper were observed in July and August, and mean density among habitat types (shell bank, inshore mud, offshore mud) was similar (range: 50–52 ind hectare?1) in 2000. Alternatively, a habitat effect was detected during a limited survey conducted in 2001, with density higher on the shell bank than inshore or offshore mud habitat. Postsettlement red snapper were first detected at approximately 16 mm standard length, and individuals less than 20 mm were present in all habitats. Estimated ages of red snapper ranged from 26 to 121 d, with new settlers (?20 mm) typically less than 28 d. Predicted hatch dates ranged from early April to mid August with a single peak occurring from late May to early June. Growth rate for the April–May cohort (0.817 mm d?1) was similar to the June–July cohort (0.830 mm d?1). Habitat-specific differences in growth were observed, and rates were highest for individuals from the inshore habitat (0.881 mm d?1). Mortality rates (Z) during the early post-settlement period were approximated using catch curves, and early life mortality of red snapper was 12.1% d?1 (<f>Z=0.129</f>). While the difference in mortality between cohorts was negligible, a habitat-specific difference in mortality was observed. Mortality rate of red snapper inhabiting the inshore mud habitat (<f>Z=0.045</f>, 4.4% d?1) was lower than rates observed for individuals on the shell bank (<f>Z=0.120</f>, 11.9% d?1) or offshore (<f>Z=0.099</f>, 9.3% d?1) habitat. Individuals residing in the inshore habitat had significantly higher growth rates and significantly lower mortality rates, suggesting that recruitment potential was higher for these individuals.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=12311606&site=ehost-live

Stock assessment results and related regulatory actions are contentious in both regions. We assessed the relative availability of information to support Red Snapper assessment and management between the two regions by performing a literature review and comparing the number of region-specific, Red Snapper–focused peer-reviewed publications. One hundred and ten publications (over the period 1982–2013) were identified in this search, with 94% focused on Gulf of Mexico waters. We then assessed the available information on juvenile (?150 mm total length) Red Snapper. Twenty-eight peer-reviewed publications focused entirely or partially on juvenile Red Snapper in Gulf of Mexico waters. None documented the occurrence of juvenile Red Snapper in southeastern U.S. Atlantic Ocean waters. For the Gulf of Mexico, more than 50,000 records of juvenile Red Snapper were identified in a single trawl survey database.

Density of low-relief structures was not a significant habitat element, and an inverse association was found between juvenile red snapper abundance and the density of offshore platforms. Results of the model analysis suggest that the step-like expansion of the hypoxic area (dissolved oxygen ? 2 mg/L) offshore of the mouth of the Mississippi River and west to the Louisiana-Texas border, which first occurred in 1993, has reduced habitat carrying capacity for juvenile red snapper in this region by up to 25%, averaging 19%.

Off coastal Alabama there are few natural reefs, but in the last 50 years government programs and private fishers have placed numerous artificial reefs in the northeast Gulf of Mexico with the goal of increasing fisheries production. We examined the effects of artificial reef depth and reef type on Red Snapper densities and size distributions. We used hook-and-line, fish trap, and scuba visual surveys to estimate Red Snapper densities on four types of artificial reefs: army tanks, pyramids, small reefs (e.g., metal cages, pipelines), and large reefs (e.g., ships, dry docks, oil platforms). Small Red Snapper (<33 cm TL) were significantly more abundant at shallower depths (<35 m) and on small artificial reefs. Army tanks showed significantly more large fish (>33 cm TL) at shallow sites (<35 m) than at deeper sites (>35 m); in contrast, pyramids showed significantly more large fish at deeper sites. Ontogenetic habitat shift and fishing mortality were the most likely factors that would explain these Red Snapper distributions. Worldwide, artificial reefs are being used to enhance fishery resources and for habitat restoration. We document the importance of reef design and deployment location for Red Snapper, as well as the need for future artificial reef deployments to consider the relevant variables that affect the species that managers are attempting to enhance.

Red snapper were tagged with depth transmitters and movements were tracked (n = 7; VR2W Positioning System, Vemco Ltd., Nova Scotia) on an artificial reef site 28 km south of Dauphin Island, Alabama in the northern Gulf of Mexico for two years. More than 3.5 million accurate positions (?1 m) were obtained and used to assess red snapper depth patterns over monthly and hourly time periods. In addition, three-dimensional (3-D) patterns of red snapper volume use (m 3 ) were estimated based on depth and location (latitude, longitude) from >700,000 3-D positions. Red snapper depth preferences and volume use varied over time periods. Red snapper tended to stay at deeper depths during the colder months (<3 m from seafloor), and move up in the water column more frequently in the late spring and summer months ( F 23,127 = 45.5, P < 0.0001). Similarly, volume use patterns varied significantly by month (core, F 23,127 = 13.14, P < 0.0001; home range, F 23,127 = 27.6, P < 0.0001) with the smallest movements in February and largest in August (2013) or October (2014) depending on year. Diel home range volume showed that red snapper made fewer movements during night (1900–0400 h) compared to day (0600–1700 h; F 23,3585 = 13.2, P < 0.0001). The present habitat use patterns were surprising, because for the most part red snapper were previously considered a benthic oriented reef species. However, in the present study depth and volume shape patterns showed use of the entire water column during the spring and summer. These higher water column use patterns were likely related to spawning patterns and prey availability over both diel and monthly time periods, but further studies are needed to help confirm such correlations.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=121935851&site=ehost-live

Fish were collected from August through October 2000 in the north-central Gulf of Mexico. A total of 432 stomachs were examined, of which 164 (37%) contained prey. Size-class influenced diets; diets of small red snapper were dominated by fish, those of medium red snapper by fish and tunicates, and those of large red snapper by crabs and fish. Red snapper fed on prey from several different habitats. Small red snapper fed mostly on reef and sand prey types; medium red snapper fed on similar portions of reef, sand, and mixed prey types; and large red snapper fed on mixed prey types. Adjusting for fish size, mean gut fullness was significantly lower for the dusk than for the day period. Fish were the most important prey for all periods. The second most important prey group changed with period: stomatopods for dawn, tunicates for day, and crabs for dusk and night periods. Prey habitat type also varied over periods. Sand prey type dominated dawn and dusk periods, whereas reef prey type dominated day and night periods. We used multidimensional scaling analysis to compare the relative influence of diel period to size-class on red snapper diets. This analysis suggested that fish size-class had a greater influence on red snapper diet than did period.

Fish were collected from open sand-mud habitat (little to no relief), and artificial reef habitat (1-m³ concrete or PVC blocks), from June 1993 through December 1994. In 1994, fish settled over open habitat from June to September, as shown by trawl collections, then began shifting to reef habitat--a shift that was almost completed by December as observed by SCUBA visual surveys. Stomachs were examined from 1639 red snapper that ranged in size from 18.0 to 280.0 mm SL. Of these, 850 fish had empty stomachs, and 346 fish from open habitat and 443 fish from reef habitat contained prey. Prey were identified to the lowest possible taxon and quantified by volumetric measurement. Specific volume of particular prey taxa were calculated by dividing prey volume by individual fish weight. Red snapper shifted diets with increasing size. Small red snapper (<60 mm SL) fed mostly on chaetognaths, copepods, shrimp, and squid. Large red snapper (60-280 mm SL) shifted feeding to fish prey, greater amounts of squid and crabs, and continued feeding on shrimp. We compared red snapper diets for overlapping size classes (70-160 mm SL) of fish that were collected from both habitats (Bray-Curtis dissimilarity index and multidimensional scaling analysis). Red snapper diets separated by habitat type rather than fish size for the size ranges that overlapped habitats. These diet shifts were attributed to feeding more on reef prey than on open-water prey. Thus, the shift in habitat shown by juvenile red snapper was reflected in their diet and suggested differential habitat values based not just on predation refuge but food resources as well.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=14252249&site=ehost-live

Red snapper Hg concentrations and ?15N values were positively and significantly correlated with fish size. In addition, red snapper collected over trawled habitats had significantly higher Hg concentrations and ?15N values than did red snapper collected from similar, nontrawled habitats. Red snapper also exhibited habitat-specific differences in Hg concentrations and ?15N values, but differences were size dependent and generally small. Our study suggests that the Hg concentrations of juvenile red snapper in the northern GOM are elevated in areas where commercial shrimp trawling occurs, possibly due to increases in both red snapper trophic position and bioavailable Hg in trawled areas. Additional studies are needed to determine whether Hg concentrations are elevated in fish from trawled areas in other marine ecosystems.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=54471855&site=ehost-live

Such data streams are essential in evaluating population trajectories that are derived largely from harvest and age composition of landings. For example, high scientific uncertainty in the most recent stock assessment of Gulf of Mexico red snapperLutjanus campechanusresulted from a conflict between trends in fishery-dependent and fishery-independent data. Because sample sizes for the latter data were an order of magnitude lower, resolution of the conflicting trends was even more problematic. Recognizing the need for cost-effective expansion of fishery-independent data in the region, we evaluated the performance of vertical longline surveys for sampling reef fish within a large artificial reef zone in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Specifically, we (1) determined species composition and the length frequency of red snapper (the dominant species captured) as a function of hook size and bait type within our survey area during 2010; (2) evaluated the effect of different soak times on catch for various hook types (a combination of hook size and bait type); and (3) utilized our results to test the effect of artificial reef type on red snapper CPUE and mean size. During March–November 2010, we conducted 532 vertical longline sets, capturing 1,217 red snapper that ranged from 184 to 827 mm FL. Mean FL of red snapper differed among hook sizes, with 3/0 and 8/0 hooks sampling smaller fish than 11/0 hooks. Soak time trials revealed a significant effect of soak time on CPUE, with peak catch rates observed at 5 min. As habitat area increased, the mean size and CPUE of red snapper increased. We conclude that our vertical longline is an effective gear for sampling red snapper, and we recommend protocols to maximize its utility and standardize its use.

Little is known about their life history or feeding biomechanics during this time. However, recent studies have shown higher growth rates for juveniles located on mud habitats adjacent to low profile reefs, perhaps because of varied prey availability and abundance. To further investigate the habitat needs of juvenile red snapper and test hypotheses of feeding development, individuals were collected from a low profile shell ridge and adjacent mud areas on Freeport Rocks, TX, USA, and divided into three size classes (""3.9, 4.0-5.9, ?6.0 cm SL). Output from a dynamic lever model suggested an ontogenetic shift in feeding morphology. Biomechanical modeling also predicted that off-ridge juveniles would have slower, stronger jaws compared with on-ridge juveniles. Kinematic profiles obtained from actual feeding events validated the models' predictive ability. Analysis of prey capture events demonstrated that on-ridge juveniles exhibited larger jaw displacements than off-ridge juveniles. Shape analysis was used to further investigate habitat effects on morphology. Off-ridge juveniles differed from on-ridge juveniles in possessing a deeper head and body. Results from model simulations, kinematic profiles, behavioral observations and shape analysis all compliment the conclusion that on-ridge juveniles exhibited more suction feeding behavior, whereas off-ridge juveniles used more biting behavior.

Information on fine-scale habitat use patterns would be helpful in evaluating this. Little is known about the fine-scale movement patterns of Red Snapper around artificial reefs. The present study examined fine-scale (?1-m accuracy) movements of Red Snapper with the Vemco VR2W Positioning System. This system enabled continuous monitoring of tagged fish from 100 to 694 d. Locations of individual fish were recorded approximately every 10 min and totaled over 1.9 million accurate locations of Red Snapper from August 2010 through May 2012. Red Snapper showed close association with the reef structure (mean ± SD distance = 26.3 ± 35.4 m) but differential habitat use in relation to both diel and seasonal periods. Home range areas (95% kernel density estimates [KDE]) were significantly larger during day than night periods and showed the lowest area use at dawn and dusk. Monthly home ranges (95% KDE) and core areas (50% KDE) were significantly larger in spring, summer, and fall than in winter and were significantly correlated with water temperature, suggesting colder winter temperatures reduced Red Snapper movement. Home range area was significantly correlated with fish size (407–590 mm standard length), and the fish in this study showed the highest site fidelity (88% still present after >10 months) of any Red Snapper in other previous studies. Red Snapper also showed use of multiple reefs within the monitoring area, as home ranges (95% KDE) showed a second peak around other artificial reefs. The high site fidelity, long-term use, and concentrated use of multiple artificial reefs confirm the importance of structured habitat for Red Snapper.

Density data from otter trawls were used to examine spatial (habitat and site) and temporal differences in fish assemblage structure using multi- and univariate procedures. Eight species accounted for 69% of the total composition and in order of decreasing abundance included shoal flounder ( Syacium gunteri), dwarf sand perch ( Diplectrum bivittatum), red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus), least puffer ( Sphoeroides parvus), silver seatrout ( Cynoscion nothus), largescale lizardfish ( Saurida brasiliensis), silver jenny ( Eucinostomus gula), and sand seatrout ( Cynoscion arenarius). Multivariate results indicated fish assemblage structure differed among habitats (ANOSIM; Global R = 0.190, P < 0.001) and survey dates (ANOSIM; Global R = 0.541, P < 0.001); however, differences among sites were negligible (ANOSIM; Global R = ?0.015, P = 0.749). Highest densities of dwarf sand perch and least puffer were found on the shell bank, while densities of shoal flounder, largescale lizardfish, and silver jenny were highest on offshore mud. In addition, smallest sizes and highest densities of six of the eight abundant species were found in July, suggesting an important period for juvenile fishes. Diversity indices also varied relative to habitat with highest Shannon diversity ( H?) and species richness (S) values for fishes associated with the shell bank.

Genetic variation and spatial autocorrelation among young-of-the-year red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in the northern Gulf of Mexico. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 67: 1240–1250.Temporal and spatial genetic variations at 18 nuclear-encoded microsatellites were assayed among age-0 Gulf red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), sampled from the 2004 and 2005 cohorts in each of five regions in the northern Gulf of Mexico (Gulf) and from a mixed-age group sampled off northwest Florida. Hierarchical analysis of molecular variance revealed genetic heterogeneity among habitat patches within regions, but not among regions. A significant, positive spatial autocorrelation of microsatellite genotypes among fish sampled within the geographic range 50–100 km was detected. Bayesian coalescent analysis of historical demography indicated a decline of nearly an order of magnitude in the effective population size for red snapper across the area surveyed. The highest posterior probability for the current effective population size was 2163, approximately four orders of magnitude smaller than the estimates of red snapper census size. The results of the study demonstrate that spatial genetic structuring among young-of-the-year red snapper in the Gulf occurs at small geographic scales and is consistent with a metapopulation stock-structure model of partially connected populations.

Furthermore, little information is available from fish collected on large natural reefs, such as those on the continental shelf edge, thought to be the historical center of abundance. Previous research indicates that little nutrition is derived directly from artificial reefs; rather the majority of prey comes from surrounding soft bottom habitat. The goal of this study was to determine if there are differences in the feeding ecology of red snapper between standing oil and gas platforms, toppled platforms designated as artificial reefs, and natural reefs on the continental shelf edge, using a combination of gut content and stable isotope analyses. Results indicate that fish dominated diets at all three sites, but that differences exist in the contribution of major prey items by percentage dry weight among habitats. Red snapper collected from standing platforms consumed primarily fish, squid, and shrimp, while greater amounts of crabs, shrimp, and other crustaceans were consumed at toppled platforms. On the natural reefs, diets varied the most, consisting of both fish and crustaceans. Stable isotope analyses suggest fish collected over the standing platforms are more enriched in ? N, indicating feeding at a higher trophic level than the other habitats. No differences were observed in mean values of ?C or ?S, indicating consistency in basal resources among habitats.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=100749886&site=ehost-live

Juveniles are especially at risk from hypoxia because they leave the plankton and transition from pelagic to demersal habitats en masse during summer, when hypoxic conditions peak. We explored the influence of hypoxia on juvenile Red Snapper by examining habitat suitability during years with low (areal extent, <10,000 km2), moderate (10,000–19,999 km2), and severe (?20,000 km2) hypoxia through retrospective analyses of groundfish data from the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program. Significant interannual variability in the strength of juvenile recruitment was evident, and in general the weakest recruitment was observed during years of severe hypoxia. The relative abundance of juveniles in shallow (9–46 m) waters off central Louisiana was significantly reduced during years of severe hypoxia; this reduction was generally accompanied by an increase in relative abundance of Red Snapper longitudinally and in deeper waters. Patterns of habitat use during summer months varied in relation to hypoxia severity, with individuals occupying sites that were deeper, colder, and of higher salinity during years of severe hypoxia. Red Snapper also exhibited ontogenetic habitat shifts into deeper, cooler, and higher-salinity waters as fish size increased. In general, Red Snapper populations appear resilient to the broad-scale effects of severe hypoxia, although more localized effects may be in force but not evident because of the many factors affecting survival.

Exact tests of genetic homogeneity and analysis of molecular variance both among cohorts within localities and among localities were non-significant. Nested clade analysis provided evidence of different temporal episodes of both range expansion and restricted gene flow due to isolation by distance. A mismatch distribution of pairwise differences among mtDNA haplotypes and a maximum-likelihood coalescence analysis indicated a population expansion phase that dated to the Pleistocene and probably represents (re)colonization of the continental shelf following glacial retreat. The spatial distribution of red snapper in the northern Gulf appears to have a complex history that likely reflects glacial advance/retreat, habitat availability and suitability, and hydrology.

Both manual and passive telemetry were used to examine fine-scale movement patterns and residence time of red snapper around artificial habitats to evaluate the importance of these structures to this species. Red snapper (550–745mm TL; n =12) were manually tracked at artificial reefs in the northeastern GOM over 24-h periods. Fish stayed near the artificial reefs (<100m, with 75% of locations within 30m of the structure), but were significantly further from the reefs at night (mean=27.5m, SD=7.1) than day (mean=19.1m, SD=8.2). Based on manual tracking, home range and mean distance from the reef increased with fish size. These fish also showed long term residence of 332–958d based on passive acoustic monitoring.

As part of a broader examination of the efficacy of this approach, a tagging study was conducted at a subset (n =9) of these unreported artificial reefs to examine the likelihood that reef fishes would remain associated with them and to test factors affecting species-specific movement. Quarterly tagging trips (n =12) were made between March 2005 and December 2007 during which 3109 fish among 12 species were tagged with internal anchor tags. Red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus, n =2114), gray triggerfish (Balistes capriscus, n =267), and groupers (Family: Serranidae, n =148), were among the most frequently tagged fishes. Eighty-six fish were recaptured on subsequent tagging trips and fishermen reported 249 recaptures caught away from study sites. Mean (SD) distance moved among recaptures with reported recapture location was 37.1 (6.6) km for red snapper (n =173), 8.8 (3.1)km for gray triggerfish (n =47), and 25.2 (14.9)km for groupers (n =26). During the study, a hurricane passed over the study area, thus adding an unplanned factor to movement analyses. Fish size, reef depth, time free, and hurricane exposure significantly affected the likelihood of red snapper movement (p <0.020), but only fish size significantly affected distance moved (p =0.036). No factors significantly affected gray triggerfish movement, and low sample size precluded statistical tests of grouper movement. Overall, results indicate that large scale (>100km) red snapper movement was not dependent on hurricane occurrence, while gray triggerfish displayed mostly limited (<10km) movement irrespective of factors tested. The scale of movement observed suggests the efficacy of unreported artificial reefs to serve as no-harvest refuges is doubtful, especially when regional fishing mortality is high. Marine protected areas may be an effective alternative approach to facilitate the recovery of overfished stocks, but would need to be expansive to account for reef fish movement.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=90103107&site=ehost-live

Initiation of a local trophic cascade thence led to declines of herbivore stocks, documented here on the West Florida shelf. These exacerbating world-wide trophic cascades have resulted in larger harmful algal blooms (HABs), already present at the base of most coastal food webs. Impacts on human health have thus far been minimal within nutrient-rich coastal regions. To provide a setting for past morbidities, consideration is given to chronologies of other trophic cascades within eutrophic, cold water marine ecosystems of the Scotian Sea, in the Gulf of Alaska, off Southwest Africa, within the Barents, White, and Black Seas, in the Gulf of Maine, and finally in the North Sea. Next, comparison is now made here of recent ten-fold increments within Florida waters of both relatively benign and saxitoxic HABs, some of which are fatal to humans. These events are placed in a perspective of other warm shelf systems of the South China and Caribbean Seas to assess prior and possible future poison toxicities of oligotrophic coastal habitats. Past wide-spread kills of fishes and sea urchins over the Caribbean Sea and the downstream GOM are examined in relation to the potential transmission of dinoflagellate saxitoxin and other epizootic poison vectors by western boundary currents over larger “commons” than local embayments. Furthermore, since some HABs produce more potent saxitoxins upon nutrient depletion, recent decisions to ban seasonal fertilizer applications to Florida lawns may have unintended consequences. In the future, human-killing phytoplankton, rather than relatively benign fish-killing HABs of the past, may be dispersed along the southeastern United States seaboard.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=60521925&site=ehost-live

We developed and applied a multi-species, individual-based model to examine the long-term effects of increasing number of reefs on fish weight, abundance, and biomass. The model simulated the population dynamics of three fish species for 50 years on a 2-dimensional spatial grid. Growth, mortality, and movement were computed each hour for individuals of red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), a croaker-like species (Micropogonias chromis), and a pinfish-like species (Lagodon rhomboides). We also included individuals of two other species (bluefish –Pomatomus saltatrix and a generic jack-like species), but only simulated their hourly movement and their effects on prey and predation of the focal species. The densities of five prey groups were simulated independently in each cell. Our results showed that increasing the number of reefs generally produced higher biomass, but at the cost of slower growth, and smaller individuals. Abundance was higher under fixed-AR recruitment and maximum refuge treatments. In all treatments there were diminishing returns on abundance and biomass with increasing number of artificial reefs. Experiment 2 showed that model results based on regularly spaced reefs were consistent with a real layout of reefs currently being sampled in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Management strategies for determining the habitat-value of reefs in the Gulf of Mexico should consider the number of reefs and the local spatial layout of the reefs to ensure they are optimally arranged. Field experiments performed should assist in resolving how fish recruit to artificial reefs and help determine their roles as fish refuges.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=67625645&site=ehost-live

Fish were surgically implanted with ultrasonic transmitters and monitored with Vemco remote receivers and Sonotronics surface receivers from August 2000 to July 2004. Four fish were manually tracked from the surface overnight, and their positions were recorded every hour for either 9 or 16 h. The total length of fish tagged was 589 ± 14 mm (mean ± SE). The number of detections by the remote receivers was 290,340 ± 44,696. By the end of this study, 5 fish were still being tracked, 8 fish had been lost immediately after tagging, 15 fish had been caught by fishers, and 26 fish had been lost after extended tracking. Red snapper were resident on artificial reefs for 218 ± 28 d, and residence time ranged from 1 to 595 d. We estimated that most (67%) of the tagged red snapper showed long-term residence (117-595 d), 13% were resident for 8-91 d, and 20% left the tagging site soon after release (<4 d). Fish were resident on the same artificial reef over all seasons (winter, spring, summer, and fall), and no seasonal changes in proximity to the reef were detected. Red snapper left the receiver range (1.6 km) for short time periods; for example, fish 25 left the reef 285 times for 1-4 h over a 335-d period. However, all fish spent most of their time (98%) within the receiver range. We detected diel changes in proximity to the reefs ( N = 8), but patterns varied. In this study, red snapper showed high site fidelity over long time periods, which suggested that artificial reefs provided suitable habitat for red snapper in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=54470981&site=ehost-live

For reef fishes, this is of particular importance due to the patchy nature of reef communities. This study estimated the spatial distribution of five reef fish species on the West Florida Shelf: gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis), mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens). Estimation was done by combining large-scale fishery-dependent catch per unit of fishing effort with small scale fishery-independent video survey observation. Catch per unit of fishing effort was obtained from vessel logbook data while video observations of reef fish presence–absence and relative abundance were made by stratified random sampling on known reef and hard-bottom habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. Relative abundance estimates showed different abundance patterns for the five species depending on depth and geographical area. Variogram modeling suggested that gag grouper, mutton snapper, and red grouper were spatially autocorrelated on reef or hard-bottom habitats at short ranges of between 0.87 and 0.95km, while red and vermilion snapper were found to be randomly distributed. Range estimates for gag grouper, mutton snapper and red grouper were supported by variograms of depth soundings in the Gulf which produced range estimates of between 1.56 and 6.34km. Combining the relative estimates of abundance from catch per unit of effort with the spatial autocorrelation parameters from video surveys allowed us to provide stochastic fish abundance estimates at scales of about 2km2.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=89216104&site=ehost-live

Divers used visual surveys to identify and count all fish present on the small reefs and estimated fish lengths in 25-mm categories during August 2008, August 2009, and September 2009. Significantly higher numbers of age-0 red snapper Lutjanus campechanus were detected on the small distant reefs (500 m) than on the small nearby (15 m) reefs in all surveys. In addition, significantly higher densities of rock sea bass Centropristis philadelphica and pygmy filefish Stephanolepis setifer were observed on the small distant reefs compared with the small nearby reefs in both August and September 2009. Mean species richness was significantly higher on the small distant reefs than on the small nearby reefs in August 2009. Differences in reef fish community structure were detected in all three surveys by using nonmetric multidimensional scaling based on Czekanowski's similarity coefficient. This study indicates that if artificial reefs are built to provide habitat for juvenile red snapper, they should not be placed in areas immediately adjacent to existing adult habitat; conversely, habitats intended for adult fish should not be placed near important red snapper nursery areas.

The potential for repopulating the eastern Gulf stock through larval transport from the more populous western stock is addressed. Transport pathways across topographic features that inhibit alongshelf flow (e.g., the Mississippi River delta, DeSoto Canyon, and the Apalachicola peninsula) and interregional larval transport are considered. An advective field of currents is developed from a large database of drifter and moored currents, augmented by an operational model to fill gaps. The starting points for larval transport are the locations and day of the year of larval captures from the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program ichthyoplankton surveys. Because the field of currents is derived from near-surface observations and the depth distribution of larvae is uncertain, findings are expressed in terms of maximal transport pathways. Transport pathways were principally vectored toward the west during September, October, and May under the influence of relatively strong climatological westward wind stress. Eastward pathways occurred in June, July, and August under the influence of weaker shoreward wind stress. Westward transport pathways past the Mississippi delta were found near the delta, whereas eastward transport pathways were found in deeper waters beyond the continental shelf break, away from typical juvenile settlement habitat. Water movement from east to west across the Apalachicola peninsula occurred in the fall, suggesting the potential for genetic exchange from the eastern to the western Gulf. Eastward water movement across the Apalachicola peninsula occurred in July, but only along the outer shelf.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=54471917&site=ehost-live

Red snapper management began in 1989; the stock is now showing signs of recovery. The Gulf of Mexico Fishery Management Council has been slow to sufficiently reduce catches of the directed fisheries to rebuild the stock in a timely fashion, although compliance with the Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization Act of 2006 (MSRA) required substantial cuts in the harvest of red snapper beginning in 2007. In our opinion, this could have been avoided if conservative management practices had been adopted earlier. We believe that 'faith-based fisheries' arguments have been used to defer effective management of red snapper in the Gulf, which in turn has strained the relationship between science, management, and stakeholders there. We provide a simple empirical argument and alternate interpretations of a recently published perspective on the historical fishery of red snapper in the Gulf to conclude that the preponderance of evidence used in the agency stock assessment process, and the simple arguments made here, do not support the perspective that the red snapper stock has increased in size sufficiently to defer compliance with the MSRA.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=60590860&site=ehost-live

Differences were examined between management subunits by comparison of the size and age structure and growth rates of red snapper among recreational catches from 6 regions of the GOM: South Texas, North Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Northwest Florida, and Central Florida. In all of these regions, red snapper sampled in 2009 and 2010 were small and predominantly from age classes that represented the strong recruitment for the year classes of 2004–06. As such, our data indicate a highly truncated age structure with few fish older than 6 years. Demographic differences in size, age, and growth parameters were found. Small (?550 mm in total length), fast-growing individuals dominated the catches in South Texas and the regions of Florida, whereas larger, slower-growing fish represented the majority of catches in Alabama and Louisiana. The potential mechanisms affecting observed demographic variation include environmental differences, fishing pressure, habitat preference, and management regimes; however, no definitive conclusion about cause and effect can be made.

Few studies have examined basin-scale variation in Hg accumulation in marine ecosystems, and determining if Hg concentrations in fish tissue vary across marine ecosystems is a key monitoring question. The present study evaluated Hg concentrations in red snapper ( Lutjanus campechanus) tissue across three regions of the northern Gulf of Mexico (Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, USA) and between two habitat types (oil and gas platforms and nonplatforms) within each region. Nitrogen (?15N), carbon (?13C), and sulfur (?34S) stable isotopes were used to investigate ecological differences that may affect Hg concentrations among regions and between habitats. Mercury concentrations in red snapper tissue were positively correlated with fish total length. Regional differences in Hg concentrations were significant, with fish collected from Alabama having the highest concentrations and fish collected from Louisiana having the lowest. No significant difference existed in Hg concentrations between habitats, suggesting that association with platforms may not be a significant factor contributing to red snapper Hg concentrations. While ?15N did not differ significantly among the three regions, Texas red snapper were more enriched in ?34S and depleted in ?13C compared with Alabama and Louisiana red snapper. Although the majority of red snapper collected in the present study had Hg concentrations below safe consumption guidelines, regional differences suggest that spatially explicit monitoring programs may be important for basin-wide assessments.

Therefore, it is important to understand how estimates of these variables are affected by factors such as capture depth and water temperature. The meta-analytical approach to modeling used here for red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) in the Gulf of Mexico provides a robust method for dealing with studyspecific differences in experimental protocols and for estimating release (discard) mortality as a function of key factors. Results of this analysis showed significant increases in mortality by depth and for the commercial sector. The most consistent result was the positive correlation between depth and estimates of release mortality, a relationship that was present regardless of study method, fishing sector, hook type used, or season of study. The effect of venting (deflating the swim bladder by puncture) was dependent on whether the study produced estimates of immediate or delayed mortality. Immediate estimates indicated that mortality rates are lowered by venting whereas delayed estimates indicated that venting increased mortality rates. This result is largely reflective of the use of submergence ability, from surface-release studies, as a proxy for mortality. The model's interaction result indicates that recompression of fish may be a viable alternative to venting and that, if a recompression device is not available, venting at least improves the likelihood that a fish can submerge and return to protective habitat. The depth-based functional relationships developed in this model were used in the most recent red snapper stock assessment in 2012, and that use was a change from previous assessments where region-specific point estimates were used.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=98884849&site=ehost-live

Liver energy reserves were highest in spring and decreased during summer, with greater LSI values at natural reefs in spring. While female red snapper LSI was greater than males at the natural reefs, indicating a larger energetic investment for spawning, it did not differ between males and females at the artificial reefs. Females at natural reefs have the ability to invest more energy in reproduction than females at artificial reefs, which is reflected in larger female LSI values at the natural reefs. Caloric density was highest in winter and decreased through fall at the natural reefs, with the opposite trend observed at artificial reefs. Muscle energy reserves are likely utilized for gonad development, while stored liver energy is utilized during and after spawning.

Specifically, our goal was to assess the overall performance of a standard otter trawl, a small fish trap, a chevron trap, and a stationary 4-camera underwater video array during six quarterly sampling cruises performed in 2004 and 2005. The sizes of snapper captured by trawls ranged from 30 to 250mm total length (TL) (ages 0 and 1yr). Trawls captured the most red snapper per unit area and had q-ratios of 3:1 to 5:1 relative to small fish traps for juvenile red snapper. The chevron trap collected the second highest number of red snapper and proved most useful at collecting red snapper from 150 to 440mm TL (ages 1–5yr).

Spatial and Dietary Overlap Creates Potential for Competition between Red Snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and Vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens).,"Davis, William T.; Drymon, J. Marcus; Powers, Sean P.",PLoS ONE,19326203,,12/2/2015,10,12,1,16,111325841,10.1371/journal.pone.0144051,Public Library of Science,Article,LUTJANUS campechanus; RESOURCE management; REEF fishes; FISH feeds; FISH habitat; COMPETITION (Biology); Other Animal Food Manufacturing,Research Article,"Understanding the complex nature of direct and indirect species interactions is a critical precursor to successful resource management. In the northern Gulf of Mexico fisheries ecosystem, red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens) are two commercially harvested species within a larger reef fish complex. These two species share similar habitats and diets; however, little is known about how these species partition habitat and dietary resources. In this study we examined the extent of spatial and dietary overlap between red snapper and vermilion snapper, and experimentally compared their feeding behavior. Field data from multiple gear types demonstrates that red snapper and vermilion snapper frequently cohabited reefs in the northern Gulf of Mexico, and Pianka’s niche overlap indices suggest significantly overlapping diets. Experimental manipulations show that red snapper are the dominant forager of the two species, as red snapper foraging alone ate more shrimp per fish than vermilion snapper in both the single species (p = 0.003) and mixed species (p = 0.02) treatments. In addition, red snapper ate significantly more shrimp per fish in the mixed species treatment than in the single species treatment (p = 0.04). Vermilion snapper shrimp consumption per fish did not differ significantly between mixed and single species treatments. Cumulatively, our results suggest that spatial and dietary overlap could lead to competition between red and vermilion snapper in the study area; however, conclusively determining the existence of such competition would require further research.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=111325841&site=ehost-live

Fish showed 12.7% survival after 7 months on small habitats (0.86 m3) and 3.1% survival after 8 months on large habitats (3.9 m3). Emigration was estimated by the movement of fish to unstocked habitats and accounted for 76.8% of the total decline in abundance at release sites after 26 days. Fish showed higher survival and growth rates on small habitats (27.6% at 26 days; 0.33 mm day?1) compared with large habitats (13.2% at 34 days; 0.26 mm day?1), which may have been due to increased predation and competition on large habitats. Fish became evenly distributed among adjacent habitats 26 days after release, indicating that stocking densities at release habitats were above carrying capacities. These observations suggested that providing additional habitat around red snapper release sites would increase survival.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=36162022&site=ehost-live
Temporal and spatial comparisons of the reproductive biology of northern Gulf of Mexico (USA) red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus) collected a decade apart.,"Kulaw, Dannielle H.; Jr.Cowan, James H.; Jackson, Melissa W.",PLoS ONE,19326203,,3/29/2017,12,3,1,39,122143747,10.1371/journal.pone.0172360,Public Library of Science,Article,LUTJANUS campechanus; FISH spawning; SEXUAL maturity in fishes; FISH stocking; BIOMASS; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries,Age groups; Agriculture; Alabama; Animal cells; Biology and life sciences; Bodies of water; Cell biology; Cellular types; Developmental biology; Earth sciences; Fecundity; Fisheries; Geographical locations; Germ cells; Gulf of Mexico; Gulfs; Louisiana; Marine and aquatic sciences; Modes of reproduction; North America; Oocytes; Ova; People and places; Population biology; Population groupings; Population metrics; Research Article; Sexual reproduction; Spawning; United States,"In studies done a decade apart, we provide evidence of a recent shift toward a slower progression to sexual maturity as well as reduced egg production, especially among young, small female red snapper, in the Gulf of Mexico (Gulf). Slower maturation rates (among fish ?6 years old), lower GSI values and decreased spawning frequency were observed, and were especially pronounced in the northwestern Gulf. Furthermore, an Index of Reproductive Importance showed that young fish (ages 2–7) are contributing far less to the spawning stock in recent years, while older fish (>8 years) are contributing more, when compared to fish from the same age groups sampled in the previous decade. Coincident with these changes in reproductive output, fishing pressure has steadily declined gulf-wide, and spawning stock biomass and spawning potential ratio have increased. Thus, it is possible that the age structure of the red snapper stock is becoming less truncated, or that reproductive effort observed is due to the temporary influence of recent strong year classes produced in 2004 and 2006 as they begin to reach full reproductive potential. If the latter is true, careful documentation of the stock’s reproductive dynamics during a time of population growth provides new understanding at the meta-population spatial and decadal temporal scales. In contrast, if the former is true, a truncated age structure due to overharvest can limit the productivity of the Gulf red snapper stock. In addition, we have learned that red snapper females in the northwestern Gulf collected on natural reefs and banks have much higher reproductive output than those on artificial reefs in the form of standing and toppled oil and gas platforms, thus making the need to know the relative abundance of females found on these disparate habitats an important next step toward better-understanding factors impacting the reproductive dynamics of this species.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=122143747&site=ehost-live

Artificial reefs were built in June 2003; half were coated with copper-based paint to prevent epibenthic community development. Reefs were surveyed by SCUBA divers to estimate fish abundance in the autumn and winter 2003 and spring 2004. Total fish abundance and abundance of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus (Poey), and gray triggerfish, Balistes capriscus Gmelin, were significantly ( P ? 0.05) higher on reefs with epibenthic communities. In the spring 2004, the abundance of belted sandfish, Serranus subligarius (Cope), the size of red snapper and community measures of diversity and evenness were significantly ( P ? 0.05) greater on unpainted reefs. These significant differences provide evidence that reef fishes were positively affected by the presence of epibenthic organisms that probably provided increased food resources.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=44133265&site=ehost-live

These studies have mostly examined natural reef systems, but results differed. To examine this relation, we built 1 m2 habitats with 20 replicates of five complexity levels from July to August 2001 in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico ( n=100). In June and July 2002, we built new habitats using the 2001 design, but also added a sixth complexity level ( n=120). In order of increasing complexity these included: cage, shell, cage-shell, block-shell, cage-block-shell, and shell-block-pyramid habitats. Most fish in both years were juveniles and included species common to reef structures in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico. In 2001, we identified 26 fish species, and the dominant species was red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus (41%), followed by rock sea bass, Centropristis philadelphica (23%), and sand perch, Diplectrum spp . (14%). In 2002 we identified 36 species, and the dominant species was tomtate, Haemulon aurolineatum (36%), followed by Diplectrum spp. (19%), and L. campechanus (13%) . In 2001, species diversity and richness were significantly ( P<0.05) higher on more complex habitats ( H?=1.7, S=11–12) compared to less complex habitats ( H?=0.8–1.0, S=4–9). In 2002, patterns among diversity, richness and reef complexity were less apparent with only the least complex habitats shell and cage showing significantly lower values. In both years, multidimensional scaling grouped by complexity levels with cage and shell habitats showing the clearest separation from other habitat types. Also, with few exceptions (only 8%) analysis of similarities showed significant ( P<0.05) differences in fish communities across complexity levels. Although community composition varied between years, this study provided evidence to support the hypothesis that habitat complexity increased reef fish species diversity.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=21588005&site=ehost-live
