"Age Composition, Growth, and Density-Dependent Mortality in Juvenile Red Snapper Estimated from Observer Data from the Gulf of Mexico Penaeid Shrimp Fishery.","GAZEY, WILLIAM J.; GALLAWAY, BENNY J.; COLE, JOHN G.; FOURNIER, DAVID A.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Dec-08,28,6,1828,15,36871572,10.1577/M07-216.1,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Fisheries; Bycatches (Fisheries); Fish populations; Mexico, Gulf of; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Lutjanus campechanus; Mortality",,"Beginning in May 1998, the National Marine Fisheries Service has required that bycatch reduction devices be installed in penaeid shrimp trawl gear in the Gulf of Mexico. Changes in observer protocols were introduced, one of which was that all of the red snapper Lutjanus campechanus collected would be enumerated and measured when possible. This change has yielded catch and length information from the Gulf of Mexico shrimp fishery. To date, however, an integrated approach to determining the age composition, growth, and mortality of juvenile red snapper has not been attempted. To address this problem, we constructed a length-based, age-structured model to objectively estimate the growth and mortality parameters and age composition of the shrimp trawl bycatch of red snapper in the western Gulf of Mexico from 81 monthly length frequency data sets (a total of 239,521 fish were measured) from July 1999 to February 2007. Our modeling strategy was to make simple and straightforward representations of the deviations in growth from the mean trend, partial recruitment, density-dependent mortality, and population dynamics. Bayesian parameter estimation was accomplished by calculating the mode of the posterior distribution. Important findings of this paper include (1) the shrimp trawl bycatch during the first and third trimesters is dominated (86-87%) by age-0 fish, (2) the growth patterns of age-0 and age-1 red snapper suggest that the fish form an opaque annulus in winter months, (3) the natural mortality of age-0 fish appears to be about double (a minimum 70% increase) the value used in the last stock assessment, and (4) the evidence for density-dependent juvenile mortality is overwhelming. Inclusion of these findings in the red snapper stock assessment has the potential to substantially alter management practices.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=36871572&site=ehost-live

In addition, otolith-based methods were used to determine age, hatch-date, growth and mortality of new recruits associated with FRBH. Date and region were significant factors affecting density of red snapper in 2000. Peak densities of red snapper were observed in July and August, and mean density among habitat types (shell bank, inshore mud, offshore mud) was similar (range: 50–52 ind hectare?1) in 2000. Alternatively, a habitat effect was detected during a limited survey conducted in 2001, with density higher on the shell bank than inshore or offshore mud habitat. Postsettlement red snapper were first detected at approximately 16 mm standard length, and individuals less than 20 mm were present in all habitats. Estimated ages of red snapper ranged from 26 to 121 d, with new settlers (?20 mm) typically less than 28 d. Predicted hatch dates ranged from early April to mid August with a single peak occurring from late May to early June. Growth rate for the April–May cohort (0.817 mm d?1) was similar to the June–July cohort (0.830 mm d?1). Habitat-specific differences in growth were observed, and rates were highest for individuals from the inshore habitat (0.881 mm d?1). Mortality rates (Z) during the early post-settlement period were approximated using catch curves, and early life mortality of red snapper was 12.1% d?1 (<f>Z=0.129</f>). While the difference in mortality between cohorts was negligible, a habitat-specific difference in mortality was observed. Mortality rate of red snapper inhabiting the inshore mud habitat (<f>Z=0.045</f>, 4.4% d?1) was lower than rates observed for individuals on the shell bank (<f>Z=0.120</f>, 11.9% d?1) or offshore (<f>Z=0.099</f>, 9.3% d?1) habitat. Individuals residing in the inshore habitat had significantly higher growth rates and significantly lower mortality rates, suggesting that recruitment potential was higher for these individuals.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=12311606&site=ehost-live

Off coastal Alabama there are few natural reefs, but in the last 50 years government programs and private fishers have placed numerous artificial reefs in the northeast Gulf of Mexico with the goal of increasing fisheries production. We examined the effects of artificial reef depth and reef type on Red Snapper densities and size distributions. We used hook-and-line, fish trap, and scuba visual surveys to estimate Red Snapper densities on four types of artificial reefs: army tanks, pyramids, small reefs (e.g., metal cages, pipelines), and large reefs (e.g., ships, dry docks, oil platforms). Small Red Snapper (<33 cm TL) were significantly more abundant at shallower depths (<35 m) and on small artificial reefs. Army tanks showed significantly more large fish (>33 cm TL) at shallow sites (<35 m) than at deeper sites (>35 m); in contrast, pyramids showed significantly more large fish at deeper sites. Ontogenetic habitat shift and fishing mortality were the most likely factors that would explain these Red Snapper distributions. Worldwide, artificial reefs are being used to enhance fishery resources and for habitat restoration. We document the importance of reef design and deployment location for Red Snapper, as well as the need for future artificial reef deployments to consider the relevant variables that affect the species that managers are attempting to enhance.

Effect of Hypoxia on the Distribution of Fishes Associated with a Petroleum Platform off Coastal Louisiana.,"Stanley, David R.; Wilson, Charles A.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,May-04,24,2,662,10,13745575,,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,Hypoxia (Water); Fishes; Underwater acoustics; Surveys; Sampling (Process),,"A combination of hydroacoustics and visual survey techniques were used to estimate the abundance, size distribution, and species composition of fishes at a petroleum platform in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The effect of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration on the density and distribution of fishes at this de facto artificial reef was examined. The techniques used permitted surveys of the entire water column, providing a more accurate reflection of the effect of a highly variable phenomenon (i.e., hypoxia) that may not be measured with traditional fisheries sampling equipment. Hypoxic conditions were observed during two of the five trips to the petroleum platform, South Timbalier 54. When hypoxia was present, fish density was dramatically higher in the strata immediately above the hypoxia. It was difficult to determine the exact impact of hypoxia on target strength (a measure of fish size), as the larger mean target strengths observed in the spring and summer may be due to seasonal factors and not to hypoxia alone. With the exception of the fall 1995 survey (which had significantly higher density and abundance estimates than other surveys), the estimated number of fishes did not vary among any of the sample periods. Even when 32% (15-22 m) of the water column was hypoxic (summer 1996), abundance estimates were slightly higher than in other survey periods without hypoxia (except fall 1995). While hypoxia reduced the availability of the water column to fishes, they concentrated where favorable DO levels were found. This included demersal species such as red snapper Lutjanus campechanus, which were found higher in the water column than expected.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=13745575&site=ehost-live

Red snapper were collected quarterly during 2004 and 2005 over sand, low-relief shell rubble, high-relief shell rubble, and natural high-relief reef habitats within a de facto nontrawl area and in similar habitats on the open shelf where commercial shrimp trawling occurred. Age-0 red snapper were most dense over sand and low-relief shell rubble habitats and moved to higher-relief shell rubble and natural reef habitats by age-1. Habitat-specific daily growth rates of age-0 fish were highest over sand (range 0.65–1.03 mm·day–1). Densities of age-0 red snapper were highest over trawled sand, but higher over nontrawled shell rubble by 6 months of age (age-0.5+). Red snapper collected over sand and low-relief shell rubble areas exposed to trawling had truncated size distributions, higher mortality estimates, and lower production potential (the latter evaluated with G–Z and P–B ratios) compared with fish over nontrawled areas of similar habitat. Results suggest that juvenile red snapper residing over nontrawled areas may have a higher probability of survival than fish in areas exposed to commercial shrimp trawling.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=a9h&AN=35288930&site=ehost-live
Experimental assessment of circle vs. J hook performance and selectivity in the northern Gulf of Mexico recreational reef fish fishery.,"Garner, Steven B.; Patterson III, William F.; Porch, Clay E.",ICES Journal of Marine Science / Journal du Conseil,10543139,,May/Jun2017,74,5,1437,11,123571162,10.1093/icesjms/fsx001,Oxford University Press / USA,Article,"Mexico, Gulf of; Sporting and Athletic Goods Manufacturing; Sporting Goods Stores; All other sporting goods stores; Fishhooks; Fishing tackle; Balistidae",circle hook; grey triggerfish; Gulf of Mexico selectivity; red snapper; reef fish; traumatic hooking,"Few data exist to evaluate the performance or assess the potential impacts of hook regulations on catchability or selectivity of recreational fisheries in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The purpose of this study was to test the effects of hook type (circle vs. J hook) and hook size (1/0, 4/0, and 7/0) on catch composition, traumatic hooking, species-specific catches, and size-selectivity of red snapper, Lutjanus campechanus, and grey triggerfish, Balistes capriscus. Selectivity was estimated by conditioning size distributions from hook-specific catches against in situ size distributions observed with a remotely operated vehicle. Deep hooking (hook set in gills or beyond) was low in all hook treatments for red snapper (<10%) and grey triggerfish (<6%), but was generally higher with J hooks, especially for other fishes caught with the largest J hook (34%). Hook type did not significantly affect catches, but catches decreased significantly with increasing hook size in all groups except red snapper. Selectivity curves were dome-shaped for both focus species in all hook treatments and selection peaks were similar among treatments for red snapper. Peak selectivity was 78.1mm larger for J hooks than circle hooks for grey triggerfish. Overall, study results indicate that the circle hook regulation may have reduced traumatic hooking mortality by up to 50%, and that catchability is similar between hook types for both red snapper and grey triggerfish when controlling for hook size. Strong dome-shaped selection estimated for nearly all selectivity curves suggest logistic size-selectivity assumptions in assessment models are likely inappropriate for recreational sectors targeting red snapper or grey triggerfish.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=123571162&site=ehost-live

No significant differences in allelic richness, gene diversity, or allele (or genotype) distributions at 16 nuclear-encoded microsatellites were found between the five bycatch samples and reference samples taken from the same geographic area. These results indicate that red snappers taken as bycatch neither have reduced genetic variation relative to the local population nor do they appear to represent a non-random sample from the local population in terms of allele or genotype distributions. Estimates of the within-sample variance of pairwise relatedness did not differ significantly from zero for any bycatch or reference sample.

Allelic and haplotypic variation was assayed at 11 microsatellite loci and mitochondrial DNA, respectively. Samples taken as bycatch from shrimp trawls did not differ from the reference group in allele richness, gene diversity, or allele frequency, indicating that most of the genetic variability within the cohort studied was attributable to fish sampled during single, localized tows of the shrimp trawler. Estimates of the variance of pairwise relatedness in the reference sample and in one of the bycatch samples were zero, whereas in the other bycatch sample the variance estimate was 0.001 ( P = 0.1).

Exact tests of genetic homogeneity and analysis of molecular variance both among cohorts within localities and among localities were non-significant. Nested clade analysis provided evidence of different temporal episodes of both range expansion and restricted gene flow due to isolation by distance. A mismatch distribution of pairwise differences among mtDNA haplotypes and a maximum-likelihood coalescence analysis indicated a population expansion phase that dated to the Pleistocene and probably represents (re)colonization of the continental shelf following glacial retreat. The spatial distribution of red snapper in the northern Gulf appears to have a complex history that likely reflects glacial advance/retreat, habitat availability and suitability, and hydrology. Habitat availability/suitability and hydrology may partially restrict gene flow among present-day red snapper in the northern Gulf and give rise to a metapopulation structure with variable demographic connectivity.

For reef fishes, this is of particular importance due to the patchy nature of reef communities. This study estimated the spatial distribution of five reef fish species on the West Florida Shelf: gag grouper (Mycteroperca microlepis), mutton snapper (Lutjanus analis), red grouper (Epinephelus morio), red snapper (Lutjanus campechanus), and vermilion snapper (Rhomboplites aurorubens). Estimation was done by combining large-scale fishery-dependent catch per unit of fishing effort with small scale fishery-independent video survey observation. Catch per unit of fishing effort was obtained from vessel logbook data while video observations of reef fish presence–absence and relative abundance were made by stratified random sampling on known reef and hard-bottom habitat in the Gulf of Mexico. Relative abundance estimates showed different abundance patterns for the five species depending on depth and geographical area. Variogram modeling suggested that gag grouper, mutton snapper, and red grouper were spatially autocorrelated on reef or hard-bottom habitats at short ranges of between 0.87 and 0.95km, while red and vermilion snapper were found to be randomly distributed. Range estimates for gag grouper, mutton snapper and red grouper were supported by variograms of depth soundings in the Gulf which produced range estimates of between 1.56 and 6.34km. Combining the relative estimates of abundance from catch per unit of effort with the spatial autocorrelation parameters from video surveys allowed us to provide stochastic fish abundance estimates at scales of about 2km2.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=89216104&site=ehost-live

Release mortality associated with catastrophic decompression (CD) is a possible cause for the continuing decline, although to date no physiological data exist to support this assumption. Using a flow-through high-pressure chamber, subadult red snapper were acclimated to 101.2, 405.3, 608.0, and 1,215.9 kPa, simulating depths typical of their distribution (as deep as 200 m), and then decompressed at a rate of 10.1 kPa/s. Lateral and dorsal X-ray imaging in combination with necropsy showed that swim bladders expanded in a predictable manner. Ventral expansion into the caudal body cavity space occurred at lower pressures, whereas expansion into the cranial portion of the body cavity occurred at the highest pressure. Expansion patterns resulted in over 70 different overexpansion injuries, the most severe being to vital organs. Our results suggest a specific suite of clearly identifiable injuries associated with CD that increase in number and severity as retrieval depth increases.

The validity of this assumption is essential to management decisions because measures of growth can differ for nonmixing populations. We examined growth rates, size-at-age, and length and weight information of red snapper collected from the recreational harvests of Alabama (n=2010), Louisiana (n=1905), and Texas (n=1277) from 1999 to 2001. Ages were obtained from 5035 otolith sections and ranged from one to 45 years. Fork length, total weight, and age-frequency distributions differed significantly among all states; Texas, however, had a much higher proportion of smaller, younger fish. All red snapper showed rapid growth until about age 10 years, after which growth slowed considerably. Von Bertalanffy growth models of both mean fork length and mean total weight-at-age predicted significantly smaller fish at age from Texas, whereas no differences were found between Alabama and Louisiana models. Texas red snapper were also shown to differ significantly from both Alabama and Louisiana red snapper in regressions of mean weight at age. Demographic variation in growth rates may indicate the existence of separate management units of red snapper in the GOM. Our data indicate that the red snapper inhabiting the waters off Texas are reaching smaller maximum sizes at a faster rate and have a consistently smaller total weight at age than those collected from Louisiana and Alabama waters. Whether these differences are environmentally induced or are the result of genetic divergence remains to be determined, but they should be considered for future management regulations.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=15869595&site=ehost-live
Red Snapper Larval Transport in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.,"Johnson, Donald R.; Perry, Harriet M.; Lyczkowski-Shultz, Joanne; Hanisko, David",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,28487,,May-09,138,3,458,13,54471917,10.1577/T08-008.1,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,,,"This study examines the advection of red snapper larvae in the northern Gulf of Mexico. The potential for repopulating the eastern Gulf stock through larval transport from the more populous western stock is addressed. Transport pathways across topographic features that inhibit alongshelf flow (e.g., the Mississippi River delta, DeSoto Canyon, and the Apalachicola peninsula) and interregional larval transport are considered. An advective field of currents is developed from a large database of drifter and moored currents, augmented by an operational model to fill gaps. The starting points for larval transport are the locations and day of the year of larval captures from the Southeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program ichthyoplankton surveys. Because the field of currents is derived from near-surface observations and the depth distribution of larvae is uncertain, findings are expressed in terms of maximal transport pathways. Transport pathways were principally vectored toward the west during September, October, and May under the influence of relatively strong climatological westward wind stress. Eastward pathways occurred in June, July, and August under the influence of weaker shoreward wind stress. Westward transport pathways past the Mississippi delta were found near the delta, whereas eastward transport pathways were found in deeper waters beyond the continental shelf break, away from typical juvenile settlement habitat. Water movement from east to west across the Apalachicola peninsula occurred in the fall, suggesting the potential for genetic exchange from the eastern to the western Gulf. Eastward water movement across the Apalachicola peninsula occurred in July, but only along the outer shelf.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=54471917&site=ehost-live
Red Snapper Reproductive Biology in the Southern Gulf of Mexico.,"Brul, Thierry; Colás-Marrufo, Teresa; Pérez-Díaz, Esperanza; Sámano-Zapata, Juan Carlos",Transactions of the American Fisheries Society,28487,,Jul-10,139,4,957,12,54468106,10.1577/T09-125.1,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,,,"Sex ratio, size at maturity, reproductive periodicity, ovarian development pattern, and spawning ground data for red snapper from the southern Gulf of Mexico were analyzed to understand this species' reproductive biology throughout its geographical distribution. Red snapper were sampled in 1999 and 2000 from commercial fishery catches taken on Campeche Bank at depths ranging from 43 to 130 m. Overall sex ratio (male : female) and sex ratios by size-class did not differ significantly from a 1:1 ratio. First maturity was at a slightly smaller size in males (24.2 cm total length [TL]) than in females (28.3 cm TL), and maximum length percentages at first maturity were 28% for males and 34% for females. The length at which maturity was attained in 50% of females ( L50) was 31.4 cm TL. The Campeche Bank red snapper stock had a protracted spawning period from February to November, with a spawning peak occurring in early fall. Vitellogenic oocytes were continually recruited from previtellogenic oocytes during the entire spawning season, with no gap between each oocyte development stage. This means that red snapper ovaries are asynchronous and that the species can be considered a heterochronal (batch) spawner with indeterminate annual fecundity. Females in spawning condition were collected from both the northeastern and northwestern areas of Campeche Bank, near submerged or emergent coral reef structures, and at depths between 48 and 117 m. These results generally agreed with those for red snapper stocks in others regions of the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean off the southeastern United States. However, reproductive periodicity in the Campeche Bank red snapper stock apparently displayed more of an insular pattern of extended spawning in comparison with the typical continental pattern of restricted spawning reported for other regions. The latitudinal differences observed in red snapper spawning seasons could also reflect a latitudinal gradient in the intensity of seasonal environmental constraints.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=54468106&site=ehost-live

"Spatial Heterogeneity, Variable Rewards, Tag Loss, and Tagging Mortality Affect the Performance of Mark–Recapture Designs to Estimate Exploitation: an Example using Red Snapper in the Northern Gulf of Mexico.","Sackett, Dana K.; Catalano, Matthew",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Jun-17,37,3,558,16,123287893,10.1080/02755947.2017.1303007,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,"Fish tagging; Fishery management; Computer simulation; Mexico, Gulf of; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Fish mortality; Variation in fishes",,"Accurate estimates of exploitation rate are essential to the management of exploited fisheries. Tagging studies are often used to estimate exploitation rates, but the performance of these approaches depends strongly on study design characteristics and the magnitude of assumption violations. We simulated a suite of candidate study designs for 1-year high-reward and variable-reward tagging studies, exploring a range of sample sizes (number of tagged fish), exploitation rates, tagging mortality rates, tag loss rates, proportions of double-tagged fish, and spatial variation in fish density, tag releases, and fishing effort. We calculated the uncertainty, biases, and reward costs of these candidate study designs to determine the most cost-effective approach to accurately estimate exploitation rate for Red SnapperLutjanus campechanusin Alabama waters of the Gulf of Mexico. We also investigated how incorrectly assuming a 100% reporting rate would affect these study results. Our simulations demonstrated that using all high-reward tags provided more accurate and precise exploitation rate estimates than the variable-reward approach but only if 100% reporting could be safely assumed. Further, distributing tags uniformly over the study area when the true spatial distribution of the population and fishing pressure varied over that area drastically biased exploitation rate estimates, suggesting that prior knowledge of the population’s true spatial distribution over the study area is needed to ensure accurate estimates of exploitation rate. The most cost-effective study design involved tagging between 400 and 1,600 fish with high-reward tags, with 40% of the fish double-tagged, and the tags spatially distributed in the same proportion as the population. However, violation of the 100% reporting rate assumption resulted in a proportional downward bias in the estimated exploitation rate. Simulation studies such as this are critical to ensure that cost-effective study designs produce accurate and precise estimates of exploitation rate, particularly for high-value species such as Red Snapper.

The Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper IFQ Program: The First Five Years.,"Agar, Juan J.; Stephen, Jessica A.; Strelcheck, Andy; Diagne, Assane",Marine Resource Economics,7381360,,2014,29,2,177,22,96321415,10.1086/676825,University of Chicago Press,Article,Fishery economics; Finfish Farming and Fish Hatcheries; Fish prices; Profitability; Market power; Break-even analysis,five-year review; Gulf of Mexico; Individual fishing quotas; red snapper; socio-economics,"The Gulf of Mexico red snapper individual fishing quota program was implemented in 2007 to reduce overcapacity and eliminate derby fishing conditions in the commercial fishery. The five-year review of the program reveals that the number of vessels and fishing trips declined by 17% and 29%, respectively. The review also found the fishery was open year round for the first time in 20 years. Between 2007 and 2011, inflation-adjusted dockside, allocation (leased quota), and quota share prices rose by 7%, 37%, and 145%, respectively, suggesting the profitability of the fleet improved. Gini and Herfindahl-Hirschman indices indicate the distribution of shares is highly unequal, but shareholders do not have market power. The absence of quota overages and lower aggregate discard levels suggest resource stewardship improved. However, discards in the eastern Gulf remain high due to stock range expansion and insufficient allocation.

The Potential for Unreported Artificial Reefs to Serve as Refuges from Fishing Mortality for Reef Fishes.,"Addis, Dustin T.; Patterson, William F.; Dance, Michael A.",North American Journal of Fisheries Management,2755947,,Feb-16,36,1,131,9,113395095,10.1080/02755947.2015.1084406,Taylor & Francis Ltd,Article,Fish populations; Coral reef fishes; Reef fisheries; Artificial substrates (Aquatic biology); Lutjanus campechanus; Balistidae,,"This study tested the potential for 27 artificial reefs, which were deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico (nGOM) but not reported to the public, to serve as refuges from fishing mortality for reef fishes. Red SnapperLutjanus campechanus(n= 2,114) and Gray TriggerfishBalistes capriscus(n= 267) were tagged at a subset (n= 9) of the study reefs from winter 2005 to fall 2007 to estimate their site fidelity and mortality rates. Mortality was also estimated from catch curves fit to Red Snapper and Gray Triggerfish age distributions that were estimated at the study reefs both before (2005–2007) and after (2007–2008) the GPS coordinates of the above subset were advertised to the public. Red Snapper site fidelity (f), estimated by fitting Burnham's (1993) joint encounter model to tagging data, was 12.8% per year; while estimated instantaneous total mortality (Z) of Red Snapper ranged from 0.08 per year during the closed recreational fishing seasons to 1.31 per year during the open seasons. Similar estimates were not available for Gray Triggerfish due to inadequate model structure. Prior to reporting of reef coordinates to the public, estimatedZfrom the catch curve analysis was 1.04 per year for Red Snapper and 0.56 per year for Gray Triggerfish. After reporting, estimatedZincreased from 0.56 to 0.69 per year for Gray Triggerfish and from 1.04 to 1.14 per year for Red Snapper. The low site fidelity and high fishing effort in the region resulted in no discernible refuge effects for Red Snapper. A modest refuge effect occurred for Gray Triggerfish, fish which have been shown to display high site fidelity (>80% per year) to reefs; however, Gray Triggerfish mortality from fishing quickly increased following the reporting of the study reef coordinates. Our study results indicate that unreported artificial reefs that are deployed in areas of the nGOM where fishing is otherwise allowed are not likely to offer protection to reef fishery species.

Using a Gulf of Mexico Atlantis model to evaluate ecological indicators for sensitivity to fishing mortality and robustness to observation error.,"Masi, M.D.; Ainsworth, C.H.; Jones, D.L.",Ecological Indicators,1470160X,,Mar-17,74,,516,10,120445668,10.1016/j.ecolind.2016.11.008,Elsevier Science,Article,"Bioindicators; Computer simulation; Mexico, Gulf of; Fishes -- Mortality; Robust statistics; Multivariate analysis",Atlantis; Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM); Fishing effects; Gulf of Mexico,"This work provides a formal evaluation of 25 ecological indicators highlighted by the Southeast Fisheries Science Center’s IEA program as useful for tracking ecosystem components in the Gulf of Mexico. Using an Atlantis ecosystem model as an operating model, we select indicators that are quantifiable using simulation outputs and evaluate their sensitivity to changes in fishing mortality. Indicator behavior was examined using a multivariate ordination. The ordination is used to tell how well each indicator describes variation in ecosystem structure (termed ‘importance’) under different levels of fishing mortality and to reveal redundancies in the information conveyed by indicators. We determine importance using sample data from the operating model, with and without observation error added. Indicators whose importance is diminished least by error are considered robust to observational error. We then quantify the interannual noise of each indicator, where annual variability relates to the required sampling frequency in a management application. Red snapper biomass, King mackerel biomass and Reef fish catch ranked in the top 5 most important without error scenarios, and King mackerel biomass and Species richness were in the top 5 most important even after error was added. Red snapper biomass was consistently found to be the most important and most robust among fishing mortality scenarios tested, and all 4 of these indicators were found to have low levels of interannual noise suggesting that they need to be sampled infrequently. Our results provide insight into the usefulness of these indicators for fisheries managers interested in the impacts of fishing on the ecosystem.",http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=eih&AN=120445668&site=ehost-live
