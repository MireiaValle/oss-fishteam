##Conclusions and Future Directions

* Temperature, Salinity, Chlorophyll a, Dissolved Oxygen, and Location all were significant drivers
* Predictions matched observed CPUE well
* Add more drivers to model to explain more variation
    + Fishing Effort
    + Bathymetry
    + Oil spills
    + Split Gulf in half
* Expand to adults by using hook and line
* Apply framework to other species
